**Papers We Love** (*PWL*) is a community built around reading, discussing and
learning more about academic computer science papers. This is the [San
Francisco chapter's](https://paperswelove.org/chapter/sanfrancisco/) directory
of papers, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also
visit the [Papers We Love site](http://paperswelove.org/) or the [NYC chapter's
repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) for more info.

Due to
[licenses](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#respect-content-licenses)
we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see a
:scroll: emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide
links to their locations.

If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a [San Francisco
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-too/) and join the discussion.
You can also discuss *PWL* events, the content in this repository, and/or
anything related to *PWL* on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tu2VynkRWV)
server.

Past presentations are on the [PapersWeLove
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove). If you're not sure where
to find good papers or how to read papers, the [NYC chapter's
README](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/main/README.md)
is a gold mine.
